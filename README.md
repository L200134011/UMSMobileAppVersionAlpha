# UMSMobileAppVersionAlpha
This is UMS Mobile Application version alpha project. There are two aim why I make this project. First is to make my capability use Java Android Programming language. And the second is to fullfill the task from mr Bana Handaga in Software Enginering and Mobile Progamming Class. However this project is not ready yet to publish at society, must be repaired so on.
